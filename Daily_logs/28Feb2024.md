Learning of the day - 
    1. Swift pass struct and data structures as pass by value, even custom structs
    2. Classes are passed as pass by value, even custom classes

    In java however primitive types are the only ones who are passed as pass by value
    (ex, everything you write in lower case, int, float, double)
    And everything else you pass as pass by value
